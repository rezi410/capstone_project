# Social Media Blog

*This project aims to create a social media blog using React. Our blog consists of login systems (using a username and password) which will enable users to login into their profile. We will also have posts that users can create on their main page or interact with posts from other users by commenting. A direct messaging system will be implemented to allow users to have conversations with each other besides post interactions. Each user will also have their own account page. We will use authorization to verify that the user is on the correct account and as well as sessions to ensure that the user must login if they are away from their account for a long time. This will also avoid hackers being able to login to an account and tampering with it.*

*This website will be created using PaaS as its Web Hosting Service and our choice of Web Framework will be Express (Node JS) to create our functionality. Our choice for a Front-End Framework is React. To design our UI, we will be using Bootstrap to create a responsive website with a professional look. Lastly, since we will be keeping track of user information, we will create our DBMS by using MongoDB.* <br><br>
